# [Project 1: Stock Trades by Members of the US House of Representatives](https://github.com/Shrsht/Stock-Trades-by-Members-of-the-US-House-of-Representatives.git)
This Project is an exploration of the 'House Stock Watcher" data set which tracks the stock trading activity of members of the House of Representatives. The dataset contains stock information spanning the period from 2020 to 2022 and was designed to explore the possibility of insider trading among members of Congress. 
This investigation involves exploring this data set to understand whether the distribution of stock types is different among parties. We also explore the trading habits of the members and the parties as a whole, while trying to answer questions like:
*Which party does the most trades?
*Which congresspersons have made the most trades? 
*We also attempt to look into allegations of insider trading by analysing the type of stock buys that are done by congress people and the distribution of party purchases for particular stocks

# [Project 2: Statistical Language Model of the Ramayana](https://github.com/Shrsht/Statistical-Language-Model-of-the-Ramayana)
In this project, we build a Statistical Language Model using the public domain corpus of the Rāmāyana, an ancient Indian epic poem. Statistical Language Models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given "language" (the precise term is "corpus" or "corpora"). Here, "language" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. We use the Ramayana corpus as found on Project Gutenberg for the pupose of this investigation. As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is never known and thus we cannot know the true probability that a sequence of words will occur – however, we can estimate these probabilities via various methods, some of which are more reliable than others. For example, one might guess that the probability of a sentence is simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). This is one of the methods of estimating the probability of a sequence of words that we implement in this project.


# [Project 3: Python Exploration of Car and Home Sales during the Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://github.com/COGS108/Group_046-Fa22/blob/12ef633d9f2d45616f73dee446262f8eae9b6ded/FinalProjectGroup_046-Fa22.ipynb)
The goal of this project was to study and identify correlations between COVID-19 positive cases and purchases of luxury cars and houses in the United States. We use COVID-19 positive cases as an approximation of severity of public health situation at a point of time since it is close to how COVID-19 pandemic was addressed in the news and by the officials. The idea of this question was driven by our prior knowledge of difference between luxury goods and necessities and their theoretical response to different economic situations. We found that there was no relationship between total number of COVID-19 cases and house sales or car sales based on the results of linear regression models.


# [Project 4: Python BlackJack Simulation](https://github.com/Shrsht/Python-BlackJack-Simulation)
In this project, I implement a Python simulation of a Blackjack game using object-oriented programming techniques. Blackjack is a card game typically played at casinos where each player competes against the dealer to get a score closest to 21, without going over 21. At the start of the game, each player and the dealer are given 2 cards. A person's set of cards is referred to as their hand. The player's own cards (their hand) are visible to themselves and only one of the dealer's cards is visible to everyone. After everyone receives their cards, the dealer asks each player whether they would like to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current cards). Each player can hit (take a card) as many times as they would like to get their score as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Afterwards, the dealer reveals their card and decides to hit or stand. Lastly, the final scores are calculated and the winner is announced
